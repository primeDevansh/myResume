  Repository for source-controlling my resume :p
</p>
<p>
  So I make the PDF format of my resume using the very popular scriting language <b>Latex</b>. Today (27/Mar/24), after a very good game of basketball, an idea struck my mind: - <i><b>"why not source control my resume?"</b></i>.
</p>
<p>
  Till date, I was using the online website <b>'overleaf'</b> for editing and doing rest stuff on my resume. From today onwards, I will try to maintain it on GitHub. I am quite excited for this. Let's get going!
