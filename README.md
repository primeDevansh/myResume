  Repository for source-controlling my résumé :D
</p>

<p>
  To read my résumé, find the file <a href = "main.pdf"><b>main.pdf</b></a> in this repository or click <a href = "main.pdf">here</a> to get direct redirection.

  Till date, I used to contruct my résumé using the very popular scripting language <b>Latex</b>. Today (27/Mar/24), after a very good game of basketball, an idea struck my mind: - <i><b>"why not source control my résumé?"</b></i> It is not that this idea stemmed out from nowhere, I had to submit my résumé for research internship at a reputed college in Delhi and so, yeah! ideas are just ideas, ummm, actually it came out of nowhere :p
</p>

<p>
  I had been using the website <b>'overleaf'</b> for editing and doing rest stuff on my résumé. From today onwards, I will try to maintain it on GitHub. I am quite excited for this. Let's get going!

### Different Branch for Different Job Application

As far as I can understand it is always good to send role-tailored resumes when you're applying for a position. The resume should match what the requirements of the role are, making it role-tailored. To achieve this in GH, I have decided to maintain separate branches for separate applications. Here are the branches I created: (And, of course, I'd defer describing each branch for abvious privacy reasons - to save it from the evil's eye)
