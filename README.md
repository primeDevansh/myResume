  Repository for source-controlling my resume :p
</p>
<p>
  As is the case with many professionals, I contruct my resume using the very popular scriting language <b>Latex</b>. Today (27/Mar/24), after a very good game of basketball, an idea struck my mind: - <i><b>"why not source control my resume?"</b></i> It is not that this idea stemmed out from nowhere, I had to submit my resume for research internship at a reputed college in Delhi and so, yeah! ideas are just ideas, umm, actually it came out of nowhere :p
</p>
<p>
  Till date, I was using the online website <b>'overleaf'</b> for editing and doing rest stuff on my resume. From today onwards, I will try to maintain it on GitHub. I am quite excited for this. Let's get going!
