  Repository for source-controlling my résumé :p
</p>

<p>
  To read my résumé, find the file <a href = "main.pdf"><b>main.pdf</b></a> in this repository or click <a href = "main.pdf">here</a> to get direct redirection.

  Till date, I used to contruct my résumé using the very popular scripting language <b>Latex</b>. Today (27/Mar/24), after a very good game of basketball, an idea struck my mind: - <i><b>"why not source control my résumé?"</b></i> It is not that this idea stemmed out from nowhere, I had to submit my résumé for research internship at a reputed college in Delhi and so, yeah! ideas are just ideas, ummm, actually it came out of nowhere :p
</p>

  Till date, I was using the online website <b>'overleaf'</b> for editing and doing rest stuff on my résumé. From today onwards, I will try to maintain it on GitHub. I am quite excited for this. Let's get going!
